'''This is the skeleton code for the enemy-related code

This file will contain all enemy class instances

Since there are three distinct versions of the common enemy

Shooter: Keeps their distance from the player and tries to shoot from afar

Chaser: Tries to crash into the player any moment after a few seconds spawning

Bomber: Similiar to Shooter, they send a different type of projectile and is stagnant
